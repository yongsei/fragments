A dark cartoon, pixel art style illustration, atmospheric, mysterious, high detail, 350x622, file size under 500kb. Close-up shot. A corroded, intricate fragment of an ancient astrolabe. Its delicate gears are seized, but etched symbols perfectly match constellations on the torn manuscript page. It hums faintly with residual, otherworldly energy.
